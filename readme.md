Kulkens - The open source Extenject test game

Welcome to public repo of Kulkens. This game was made with Dependency Injection in mind, using a powerful tool named Extenject (formerly known as Zenject). 
Gameplay, game design, graphics, etc wasn't the part of the project, idea was to show how Extenject could be applied to a project. 

Game was made with Unity ver 2019.4.12f1 .
